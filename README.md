App Idea: Critter (?) Working title
- Running Goal App

People need to stay motivated to go on runs and reach running goals:

### Why does it need to exist?

- Helps keep runners motivated
- Make running more fun
- Track progress towards goal

### How it solves the problem:
- Game-ify your running goals
- Critter will make you feel guilty if you don't run
- unlock new levels/new characters to continue to keep users motivated to reach more goals

### What will it do?
- A tamagotchi-like critter is associated with users meeting their goals
- When user completes a run, the critter is happy and will grow
- If a user is not completing their goal, the critter is unhappy

What technologies will you use

I'd like to try to use ReactJS
I might need a database for users to login and store goal info
I might use a Strava API or NikeRun Club API

### Questions
- What is a good MVP (minumum viable product)
- What should  I keep in mind if trying to use API?
- Any helpful resources to checkout? 
- Anything to add that would make it a better idea?
